    title: Loki fails to cache entries due to Memcached out-of-memory error
    category: observability-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      Grafana Loki may emit errors when attempting to write to a Memcached backend that has run out of available memory. This results in dropped index or query cache entries, which can degrade query performance but does not interrupt ingestion.
    cause: | 
      Loki uses Memcached to cache query results and index lookups. When Memcached exhausts its allocated memory, it may respond with `SERVER_ERROR out of memory storing object\r\n`, preventing new items from being cached. Loki logs this as an exporter or client error when the storage backend rejects the cache operation.

    mitigation: |
      - Increase the memory limit allocated to your Memcached deployment.
      - Use Memcached eviction policies (e.g., LRU) or tune object size limits.
      - Monitor Memcached memory metrics (e.g., `memcached_mem_bytes`) and set alerts for high usage.
      - Consider using a more robust backend like Redis for larger or persistent caches.
