    title: Datadog CWS Instrumentation webhook registration fails without service account
    category: configuration-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - Datadog Cluster Agent fails to register its CWS (Container Workload Security) instrumentation webhook when running in `remote_copy` mode without a configured service account.
    cause: |
      - The `cluster_agent.service_account_name` configuration is missing.
      - In `remote_copy` mode, the Cluster Agent requires a Kubernetes ServiceAccount to manage its admission webhooks.

    mitigation: |
      - Set `cluster_agent.service_account_name` in your Helm values or Agent config:
        ```yaml
        cluster_agent:
          service_account_name: datadog-cluster-agent
        ```
      - Redeploy the Datadog Cluster Agent after applying the correct service account.
      - Verify that the ServiceAccount exists and has the necessary RBAC permissions.
