    title: OpenTelemetry Collector refuses to scrape due to memory pressure
    category: observability-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - The OpenTelemetry Collector may refuse to ingest metrics during a Prometheus scrape if it exceeds its configured memory limits. When the `memory_limiter` processor is enabled, the Collector actively drops data to prevent out-of-memory errors, resulting in log messages indicating that data was refused due to high memory usage.
    cause: |
      - When the Collector''s memory usage surpasses configured soft or hard thresholds, the memory_limiter processor prevents ingestion of new telemetry data. This safeguards the process from crashing but leads to temporary loss of incoming metrics.

    mitigation: | 
      - Tune the memory_limiter configuration using `limit_mib` and `check_interval`.
      - Increase resource limits for the Collector container (e.g., via Kubernetes).
      - Reduce incoming data volume or adjust scrape intervals to lower memory pressure.
      - Monitor Collector memory usage over time and adjust pipeline design accordingly.
