      title: RabbitMQ Mnesia overloaded recovering persistent queues
      category: message-queue-problems
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        - Look at the logs for the RabbitMQ container with the detection.
        - Note the discarded messages and warning that Mnesia is overloaded (`** WARNING ** Mnesia is overloaded`).
        - Review process data to view the CPU usage for the RabbitMQ cluster container
        - The RabbitMQ cluster is processing a large number of persistent mirrored queues at boot. 
        - High CPU usage indicates that the cluster is starving for additional CPU resources.
      cause: |
        - There are so many that the underlying Erlang process, Mnesia, is reporting that it is overloaded while recoving these queues on boot. 
      impact: |
        - RabbitMQ is unable to process any new messages, which can lead to outages in consumers and producers.

      mitigation: |
        - Increase the size of the cluster
        - Increase the Kubernetes CPU limits for the RabbitMQ brokers
        - Consider adjusting mirroring policies to limit the number of mirrored queues
        - Remove high-availability policies from queues where it is not needed
        - Consider using [lazy queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/lazy-queues) to avoid incurring the costs of writing data to disk
