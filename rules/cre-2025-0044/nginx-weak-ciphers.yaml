      title: NGINX Config Uses Insecure TLS Ciphers
      category: insecure-configuration
      author: Wayne Major
      description: |
        Detects NGINX configuration files that advertise obsolete and cryptographically weak ciphers (RC4-MD5, RC4-SHA, DES-CBC3-SHA). 
        These ciphers are vulnerable to several well-known attacks—including BEAST, BAR-Mitzvah, Lucky-13, and statistical biases in RC4—placing any client–server communication at risk of interception or tampering.
      cause: |
        * Legacy defaults copied forward from older configurations
        * Down-level load-balancer / reverse-proxy templates
        * Incomplete adoption of modern SSL hardening guidelines (e.g. Mozilla SSL Config Generator “modern” profile)
      impact: |
        Weak ciphers allow attackers with passive or active network access to decrypt or manipulate HTTPS traffic, undermining confidentiality and integrity guarantees. 
        In regulated environments (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2) continued use can trigger compliance violations, audit findings, or outright service blocking by modern browsers and API clients.

      mitigation: |
        - **Remove weak suites** from the `ssl_ciphers` directive (`ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!RC4:!3DES;`) or adopt a vetted baseline (Mozilla intermediate/modern).
        - **Enable TLS 1.2+** (`ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;`).
        - **Prefer forward secrecy**—include only ECDHE/DHE key-exchange suites.
        - **Test the endpoint** with tools such as SSL Labs or `testssl.sh` to verify no weak ciphers remain.
        - **Automate regression checks** within CI by linting rendered NGINX configs (e.g. `grep -E "(RC4|3DES)"`) or using OpenSSL to enumerate accepted suites (`openssl ciphers -v '...'`).
