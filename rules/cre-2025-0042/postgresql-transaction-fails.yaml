    title: PostgreSQL transaction fails with deadlock detected error in psycopg2 and Django
    category: database-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: | 
      - Applications using Django with PostgreSQL and psycopg2 may encounter `deadlock detected` errors under concurrent write-heavy workloads.
      - PostgreSQL raises this error when two or more transactions block each other cyclically while waiting for locks, and one must be aborted.
      - Django surfaces this as an `OperationalError`, and the affected transaction is rolled back.
    cause: | 
      - A deadlock occurs when multiple transactions acquire locks in different orders, causing a cycle that PostgreSQL''s deadlock detector resolves by aborting one transaction. This is more likely during bulk inserts, updates with overlapping WHERE clauses, or transactions accessing rows in inconsistent order.

    mitigation: "- Ensure that transactions access rows in a consistent order across code paths.\n- Break large transactions into smaller units of work.\n- Use explicit `select_for_update()` to control locking behavior and reduce contention.\n- Monitor PostgreSQL\u2019s `pg_stat_activity` and `pg_locks` to detect deadlock-prone queries.\n"
