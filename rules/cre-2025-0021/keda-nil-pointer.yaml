      title: KEDA operator reconciler ScaledObject panic
      category: operator-problems
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        KEDA allows for fine-grained autoscaling (including to/from zero) for event driven Kubernetes workloads. KEDA serves as a Kubernetes Metrics Server and allows users to define autoscaling rules using a dedicated Kubernetes custom resource definition.
      cause: |
        There is a known issue with the KEDA operator where the scalers cache from the ScaledObject controller is not being properly initialized. This can cause the KEDA operator to crash.
      impact: |
        Until the ScaledObject is deleted or KEDA is upgraded, the KEDA operator will continue to crash when reconciling ScaledObjects.

      mitigation: |
        - Upgrade to KEDA 2.16.1 or newer
        - Deleting the ScaledObjects on the failing cluster will also allow KEDA recovered
