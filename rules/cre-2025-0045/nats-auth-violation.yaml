    title: NATS Authorization Failure Detected
    category: authorization-problem
    author: Laurent Sibilla
    description: | 
      The NATS server has emitted an **Authorization Violation** log entry, meaning a client attempted to connect, publish, subscribe, or perform another operation for which it lacks permission. Intermittent violations often point to misconfiguration or start-up chaos. However, sustained or widespread violations can signal credential expiry or missing secrets.
    cause: |
      * Client credentials (username/password, NKey, or JWT) are missing,
        invalid, revoked, or expired.  
      * The client is connecting to the wrong account or lacks publish/subscribe
        permissions for the subject it is using.  
      * Clock skew between client and server invalidates JWT `iat`/`exp` claims.  
      * TLS / mTLS mapping failure prevents the certificate from matching an
        authorized user.  
      * Recent credential rotation not yet reflected in running deployments
        (e.g., stale Kubernetes Secret or mis-configured CI pipeline).

    mitigation: |
      - **Verify credentials** – confirm the `.creds`, NKey, or JWT files in
         the client deployment are correct and unexpired.  
      - **Check permissions** – in the server configuration (`authorization {}`)  
         or the account JWT, ensure the user/account is allowed to perform the
         attempted PUB/SUB/CONNECT operation.  
      - **Rotate or re-issue keys/JWTs** if credentials are compromised or
         expired, and update all clients.  
      - **Synchronize clocks** on clients and servers via NTP to avoid JWT
         time-skew errors.  
      - **Audit repeated failures** – turn on verbose server logs temporarily
         and review for malicious activity or configuration drift.

    impact: |
      Authorization failures block affected clients from sending or receiving messages, which can lead to back-pressure, message loss, or broader service outages in systems that rely on NATS for critical messaging.
