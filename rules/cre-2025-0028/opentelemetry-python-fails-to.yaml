    title: OpenTelemetry Python fails to detach context token across async boundaries
    category: observability-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      In OpenTelemetry Python, detaching a context token that was created in a different context can raise a `ValueError`. This occurs when asynchronous operations, such as generators or coroutines, are finalized in a different context than they were created, leading to context management errors and potential trace data loss.
    cause: |
      The issue arises when a context token is reset in a different context than it was created, violating the expectations of Python''s `contextvars` module. This is common in asynchronous workflows where the lifecycle of context tokens spans multiple contexts.

    mitigation: |
      - Ensure that context tokens are detached in the same context they were created.
      - Use `contextlib.aclosing()` to manage asynchronous generators properly.
      - Upgrade to a version of OpenTelemetry Python where this issue is addressed.    '
