      title: "CoreDNS unavailable - DNS outage imminent"

      description: >
        CoreDNS deployment is unavailable or has no ready endpoints, indicating
        an imminent cluster-wide DNS outage. This detects the failure BEFORE
        DNS queries start timing out, providing critical early warning.
      impact: >
        When CoreDNS becomes unavailable, all service discovery fails, readiness
        probes that rely on DNS begin to fail, pods cycle in and out, and the
        entire cluster can grind to a halt. This is a commonly cited root cause
        in production Kubernetes outage post-mortems.

      cause: >
        CoreDNS deployment scaled to zero replicas, pods crashed due to bad
        configuration, or underlying infrastructure issues causing CoreDNS
        pods to become unready or unavailable.
      mitigation: >
        **Immediate Actions:**
        - Check CoreDNS deployment status: `kubectl -n kube-system get deployment coredns`
        - Verify CoreDNS pod health: `kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l k8s-app=kube-dns`
        - Check CoreDNS logs: `kubectl -n kube-system logs -l k8s-app=kube-dns`
        
        **Common Fixes:**
        - Scale deployment if replicas are 0: `kubectl -n kube-system scale deploy/coredns --replicas=2`
        - Restart pods if configuration issues: `kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart deployment/coredns`
        - Verify kube-dns service endpoints: `kubectl -n kube-system get endpoints kube-dns`
