    title: SQLAlchemy create_engine fails when password contains special characters like @
    category: orm-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: | 
      - SQLAlchemy applications using `create_engine()` may fail to connect to a database if the username or password contains special characters (e.g., `@`, `:`, `/`, `#`). These characters must be URL-encoded when included in the database connection string. Failure to encode them leads to parsing errors or incorrect credential usage.
    cause: | 
      - Special characters in database credentials (such as `@`) conflict with reserved URL characters used to delimit user info, host, and port. If unencoded, SQLAlchemy misinterprets the connection string, leading to failed authentication or malformed URIs.

    mitigation: |
      - URL-encode special characters in usernames and passwords when constructing the connection string.
      - For example, replace `@` with `%40`, `:` with `%3A`, `/` with `%2F`, etc.
      - Alternatively, use the dictionary-style `create_engine(URL.create(...))` approach to avoid manual string encoding.
