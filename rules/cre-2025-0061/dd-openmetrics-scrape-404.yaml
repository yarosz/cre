    title: Datadog OpenMetrics Scrape Returns 404
    category: monitoring-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - The Datadog Agent is unable to scrape metrics from an OpenMetrics endpoint, returning a 404 Not Found error.
      - This typically indicates that the target service is either not exposing the `/metrics` path, the port or path is misconfigured, or the service is not running.
    cause: |
      - Incorrect Path: The metrics endpoint may be incorrectly configured or not implemented at the expected URL.
      - Service Not Running: The target service may not have started, or it is failing health checks and is unavailable.
      - Networking Issues: Internal DNS or IP mappings may be stale, misconfigured, or targeting the wrong pod or service.

    mitigation: |
      - Confirm the target service is healthy and exposing the `/metrics` endpoint.
      - Use `curl` or `kubectl port‑forward` to validate the endpoint from within the cluster.
      - Ensure the Datadog `openmetrics` check configuration uses the correct port and path.
      - Review service discovery and label selectors in your check configuration.
