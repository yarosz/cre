    title: AWS EBS CSI Driver fails to detach volume when VolumeAttachment has empty nodeName
    category: storage-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      In clusters using the AWS EBS CSI driver, the controller may fail to detach a volume if the associated VolumeAttachment resource has an empty `spec.nodeName`. This results in a log error and skipped detachment, which may block PVC reuse or node cleanup.
    cause: |
      The controller attempts to locate the node based on `VolumeAttachment.spec.nodeName`. If this field is empty, the controller's logic skips processing, leading to a failure in detachment flow. This commonly happens when a VolumeAttachment is deleted before node assignment completes.

    mitigation: | 
      - Upgrade to aws-ebs-csi-driver v1.26.1 or later.
      - Avoid deleting PVCs or terminating pods immediately after volume provisioning.
      - Monitor for detachment failures via controller logs.
