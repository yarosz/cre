      title: NGINX Upstream DNS Failure
      category: proxy-problems
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        When a NGINX upstream becomes unreachable or its DNS entry disappears, NGINX requests begin to fail.
      cause: |
         The upstream host or container is removed, invalidating its DNS resolution and causing requests to break.
      impact: |
         Clients experience partial or total service interruptions until the upstream is restored or reconfigured.

      mitigation: |
        - Provide a stable or redundant upstream configuration so NGINX can gracefully handle DNS resolution failures.
