      title: RabbitMQ memory alarm
      category: message-queue-problem
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        A RabbitMQ node has entered the “memory alarm” state because the total memory used by the Erlang VM (plus allocated binaries, ETS tables,
        and processes) has exceeded the configured `vm_memory_high_watermark`. While the alarm is active the broker
        applies flow-control, blocking publishers and pausing most ingress activity to protect itself from running out of RAM.
      cause: |
        - Large or rapidly growing queues keeping many messages in RAM.  
        - Messages with very large payloads or headers.  
        - Insufficient memory limits / cgroup constraints on the container or VM.  
        - Consumers that are slow, offline, or ACKing messages late, preventing RAM from being reclaimed.  
        - A too-low `vm_memory_high_watermark` setting relative to available memory on the host.
      impact: |
        - All publishers connected to the affected node are blocked until the alarm clears, creating upstream back-pressure.  
        - In a clustered deployment, mirrored queues on the node can stall, reducing overall throughput and increasing latency.  
        - If memory continues to climb, the Erlang VM may crash, causing a node restart and potential message loss for non-persistent or in-flight messages.  
        - Application components that rely on timely message delivery may experience delays or timeouts, degrading user-facing services.

      mitigation: |
        - Inspect memory usage to identify queues or processes consuming RAM: 
             `rabbitmq-diagnostics memory_breakdown -n <node>`  
        - Purge or truncate unused / dead-letter queues holding many messages.  
        - Scale or speed up consumers so messages are ACKed and cleared from memory faster.  
        - Enable “lazy queues” or set TTLs / max-length limits for queues that can tolerate disk-based storage.  
        - Increase the node’s memory allocation or raise `vm_memory_high_watermark` (e.g., to 0.8) **only** after confirming the host has sufficient physical RAM.  
        - In Kubernetes, also raise the Pod memory limit so the broker can use the additional headroom without OOM-killing.  
        - Long-term: review message sizes, batch patterns, and queue topology to prevent unbounded growth.
