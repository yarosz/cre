    title: Loki generates excessive logs when memcached service port name is incorrect
    category: observability-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - Loki instances using memcached for caching may emit excessive warning or error logs when the configured`memcached_client` service port name does not match the actual Kubernetes service port. This does not cause a crash or failure, but it results in noisy logs and ineffective caching behavior.
    cause: |
      - Loki's memcached client resolves the service by port name. If the port name is incorrect or not present in the Kubernetes service definition, the client fails to connect silently or repeatedly logs errors while retrying.

    mitigation: | 
      - Ensure that the `memcached_client` configuration references the correct Kubernetes service **port name**.
      - Match the port name exactly as defined in your memcached service. 
      - For example:
      ```yaml 
         ports:    
          - name: memcache     
            port: 11211 
      ```
      - Update your Helm values or Loki configuration accordingly.
